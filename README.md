# Student Exam Performance Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the *Students Performance in Exams* dataset from Kaggle (1,000 student records) to explore how demographic and support factors influence academic performance across math, reading, and writing.

The deliverables include:
- An **interactive Excel Dashboard** (`Students_Performance_Dashboard.xlsx`)
- A **PDF Project Brief** (`Students_Performance_Dashboard.pdf`) with charts and key insights

---

## 🎯 Objective
To investigate the impact of background factors (gender, parental education, lunch type, test preparation) on student exam performance and to demonstrate dashboard design skills in Excel.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel**: PivotTables, PivotCharts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting
- **Dashboard Design**: Clean 2×2 layout, interactive slicers, KPI scorecards
- **Visualization**: Clustered column charts with consistent color themes

- **Parental Education**: Higher parental education strongly correlates with higher performance.
- **Gender**: Females scored higher in reading/writing, males slightly higher in math.
